How do I run Python on my own computer?

* Your options depend on the device’s Operating System (Windows vs Mac vs Linux)   
  * First, install Python (Reference: [https://docs.python.org/3/using/](https://docs.python.org/3/using/))  
    * Both Mac and Linux have a version of Python available as part of the OS.  
      * Note: you may not want to use the version of Python that comes with your machine. Installing a different version of Python is recommended  so you don't want to accidentally change the version of Python that your operating system depends on\!  
    * For Python on Windows, Microsoft has several options. [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/python/beginners](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/python/beginners)  
    * A note on Anaconda: Anaconda is commercial software that provides a convenient solution for installing data science-related python libraries (among other features). Beginning in 2020, "exempt" status was revoked for non-profit and educational use so Anaconda should only be considered if it is an option you want to pay for.    
  * Then, install JupyterLab (Reference: [https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting\_started/installation.html\#pip](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html#pip))  
  * To launch JupyterLab \- in a terminal window, type:  
    * jupyter lab
